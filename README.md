# Anomaly Detection (Transactions & Sales)
Anomaly detection in synthetic transaction and sales data with Python. Generates realistic data, injects unusual events, and applies Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and Z-score methods to detect outliers. Produces anomaly reports and visualizations for portfolio-ready demonstration of data science skills.

Detect anomalies in synthetic transaction data using Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and a Z-score baseline. The project generates data, injects anomalies, runs detectors, and exports flagged rows and charts for audit.

---

## Features
- Synthetic transaction generator with anomalies (bursts, extreme purchases, negative/zero entries)
- Multi-model detection: Isolation Forest, LOF, Z-score
- Unified anomaly report with model votes and severity score
- Clean visualizations: time-series spikes and amount distribution
- Reproducible scripts with deterministic seeding

## ðŸ›  Generate Synthetic Data
```bash
python data/generate_transactions.py --start 2023-01-01 --end 2024-12-31 --seed 42 --n-customers 500 --out data/transactions.csv
```

---

## Run Anomaly Detection
```bash
python src/detect_anomalies.py --input data/transactions.csv --outdir outputs --contamination 0.02
```

**Outputs**
- `outputs/anomalies.csv` â€“ flagged rows with anomaly scores & model votes  
- `outputs/fig_amount_time.png` â€“ transaction amounts over time with spikes  
- `outputs/fig_amount_hist.png` â€“ amount distribution histogram

## Sample Results

### Transaction Amount Distribution
Shows most transactions are small (0â€“300 units). A few very large amounts (thousands) appear as outliers.

---

### Transaction Amounts Over Time
Transactions are generally stable, but occasional spikes (extreme purchases or errors) appear and are flagged as anomalies.
